# GPA Calculator by MyWikis
GPA Calculator is a PHP script for calculating high school GPAs. (We put our Java version in another repository.) We know how important your GPA is, and let's be honest - who has time to calculate their GPA when they need to study? Don't worry; it takes less than 3 minutes to get this information now! Just run our script on your website or ours. It's designed to be as adaptive yet simple as possible. And it's even condensed in one tiny script to run.

## Requirements
* For PHP: We recommend PHP 5.3 and up, as well as Apache. Who doesn't?
