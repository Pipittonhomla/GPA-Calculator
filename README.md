# GPA Calculator by MyWikis
GPA Calculator is a PHP script for calculating high school GPAs. We know how important your GPA is, and let's be honest, who has time to calculate their GPA when they need to study? Don't worry; it takes less than 3 minutes to get this information now! Just run our script on your website or ours. It's designed to be as adaptive yet simple as possible. And it's even condensed in one tiny script for you to run.

We also have a Java version that works well and an experimental Python version that we are still developing. They have their own GitHub repositories, which you may find under the names "GPA Calculator Java" and "GPA Calculator Python."

Of course, you can always use our ad-free hosted website at https://www.mywikis.com/products/srcbin/gpacalculator.php for absolutely no charge!

## Requirements
* For PHP: We recommend PHP 5.3 and up (who doesn't?), as well as Apache. These are the settings with which we tested the software, but YMMV. (Your mileage may vary.)
