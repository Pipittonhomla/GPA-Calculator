# GPA Calculator by MyWikis
GPA Calculator is a PHP/Java script for calculating high school GPAs. We know how important your GPA is, and let's be honest - who has time to calculate their GPA when they need to study? Don't worry; it takes less than 3 minutes to get this information now! Just run our script on your website or ours (for PHP), or on your computer on the command line/terminal (Java). It's designed to be as adaptive yet simple as possible. And it's even condensed in one tiny script to run.

## Requirements
* For PHP: We recommend PHP 5.3 and up. Who doesn't?
* For Java: We recommend Java 7 and up. We believe, however, that this will work well on Java 6. However, we do not support Java 6 and there are no guarantees!
